### This sketch is a game that uses a puzzle to solve to win, and an enemy as a threat to make the game more tense and fun, and as a way to lose.

>wasd keys and enter for the player movement and swapping the tiles, respectively.
>
>The twist on this game is that the enemy is invisible. there's no enemy sprite drawn. (commented out code has the enemy drawn for testing the enemy movement)
>
>you use a device displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen, similar to a sonar, to see the enemy's position.(except the spinning is just visual, the enemy is shown in delayed pings when the spinning passes the black line on the sonar, if the enemy is close enough to the player). This aspect of the game is inspired by scanner sombre, a horror game which uses a similar function to discover your surroundings in a pitch black cave. You sometimes scan what seems to be a person in the darkness, designed to scare the player as they are led to thinking they are alone.

>For my game, this invisible entity is hinted to the player to be an alien, through the description of what the entity and puzzle likely protect, and through one of the tile drawings looking like they may be of aliens.
>
>Those tiles are part of a puzzle, which the player must match to the solution provided in the bottom right corner of their screen, in order to win. for the game story, the puzzle and tiles are made and drawn by the aliens, as a measure to protect their tools and valuables. 
>
>I drew the 4 tiles and recorded the sound of tiles swapping myself. i used procreate on an ipad to draw the pngs for the tiles.
>
>the tiles are initially showing trees, meaning to keep the puzzle hidden from people, as the puzzle resides in a forest.
>
>One major change i made throughout the development was the addition of the sonar. Initially, i was planning to use sound instead for the player to work out where the enemy is. I changed this because i felt the sound method may not be effective at letting the player know the enemy's position, and would require any players to have headphones or be at a significant disadvantage. However, I do wish to revisit my initial idea later.
>
>A change i would make to the game is to add some trees in the area surrounding the puzzle. This would make the game look nicer, but also maybe make the player more aware of the story and feel rore immersed.
>
>To develop the game further i could add difficulty levels, with more/less tiles to solve the puzzle.
